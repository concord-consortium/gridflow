Artwork Sources for GridFlow
---

This directory is for holding the original artwork for GridFlow. 

Original Illustrator, Flash, etc. files uploaded by the artists should be put in this directory. Put modified or derivative versions of the artwork source files, used to generate the final assets, into the `derived/` directory. Of course, the final assets ready for use by game code should be put in `/app/assets/`.)

Try to maintain a sensible naming scheme here (though I broke from the CamelCasing used elsewhere in the app.) If a new version of a file is uploaded by an artist, but given a new name, rename it and commit the change to the resulting file. If new files are provided, try to match the naming in this folder.)
