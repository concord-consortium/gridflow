GridFlow
========
A game about managing the power grid and avoiding blackouts!  
This is a Learning Everywhere project.

Building
--------
Before you can do anything else, you'll need:

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. [Bower](http://bower.io/) (You can install using `npm install -g bower`)
3. [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) (You can install using `npm install -g brunch`)

Once you've cloned the repository, run `bower install` and `npm install`.

Now you can build using `brunch build`. The built files will appear in the `public` folder.

Even easier, `brunch watch --server` will build every time a file is changed in `app`.
The `--server` flag starts a server from `public`, so that you can head over to
`localhost:3333` in your browser and see the site update live!
